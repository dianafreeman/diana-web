#### Getting Started

This project Grunt for compilation tasks

- `default` watches all *.scss files for changes, and then runs
  - SASS, and compiles in to `/assets/css/main.css`
  - CSS Autoprefixer, and autoprefixes `/assets/css/main.css` to an autoprefixed file with the same name
- `watch` watches source files and builds them automatically whenever you save
